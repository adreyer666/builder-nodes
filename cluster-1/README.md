# Kubernetes cluster

Build a working kubernetes cluster consisting of multiple VMs.

* The `vagrant` setup was inspired by https://github.com/GuyBarros/vagrant-kubeadm-vault/blob/main/Vagrantfile.
* The actual `kubernetes` config was converted from the excellent tutorial [Running Kubernetes on your Raspberry Pi homelab](`running_kubernetes_on_your_raspberry_pi_homelab.pdf`)
